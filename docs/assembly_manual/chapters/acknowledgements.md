# Acknowledgements

Whilst the work that has been put into this project by the Millennium Machines design team is immense, we can’t take all the credit for the project as a whole. We had a lot of help along the way, and would like to take a moment to recognise a few of the entities outside of the team that helped us make all of this a reality.

To the team at OpenBuilds: As many of you may know, we originally began this journey as a mod for the OpenBuilds MiniMill, and whilst we’ve moved beyond being simply a mod, it would be remiss of us to not recognise the work that went into that project.

To the Voron Design team: Voron has also been a huge inspiration for us, from the ethos of the community driven development, to the layout and content of our manuals - and we do owe them a lot (we even use some modified Voron parts).

And finally, to Fabreeko. Early on Fabreeko had our back with support and donations so that we could afford to buy parts - and they helped us guarantee that we could provide a machine that lived up to everyones expectations. For that we are eternally grateful. Thank you all.
