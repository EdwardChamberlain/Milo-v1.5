# Acknowledgements

Whilst the work that has been put in to this project by the millennium designs team is immense we can’t take all the credit for the project as a whole, we had a lot of help along the way and would like to take a moment to recognise a few of the entities outside of the team that helped us make this all a reality.

To the team at openbuilds. As many of you may know we originally began this journey as a mod for the Openbuilds Minimill and whilst we’ve moved far beyond the capabilities of that machine it would be remiss of us to not to recognise the work that went into that project.

To the Voron team. Voron has also been a huge inspiration to us on the team from the ethos of the community driven development to the layout and content of our manuals and we do owe them a lot (we even use some modified voron parts).

And finally to Fabreeko. Early on Fabreeko had our back with support and donations so that we could afford to buy parts and they helped us guarantee that we could provide a machine that lived up to everyones expectations  for that we are eternally grateful.
