## Fan screw CS-1

![Fan screw CS-1 wireframe](../resources/hardware/cs-1.png)

A PC standard fan mounting screw. Exclusively used to hold the system cooling fans to the bottom panel.

## Heat set insert

![Heat Set Insert wireframe](../resources/hardware/heat_insert.png)

Heat inserts with a soldering tip so that they melt the plastic when installed. As the plastic cools, it solidifies around the knurls and ridges on the insert for excellent resistance to both torque and pull-out.
