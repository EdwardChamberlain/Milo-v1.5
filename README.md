Based on the openbuilds minimill, the Millenium minimill is an open-source project for DIYers to create a reliable, low cost and powerful desktop CNC mill on their own terms. The mill is designed to have the ability to cut aluminium but is also capable of cutting a vast range of softer materials such as composites, woods and plastics.
